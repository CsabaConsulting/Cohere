# Effective Date
## Category: Date
The Effective Date is entered in Step 2 and is referred to as the Point of Reference in the ThruThink analysis or the beginning point of the analysis. If no date is entered in Step 2 then the Current Date (todays date) is used as the Effective Date. The Transaction Sheet, Target Company and Existing Company Balance Sheet items should all be as of the Effective Date. The Base Sales and EBITDA inputs in Step 3 should be as of the Effective Date.
For the Existing Company, in Step 3, there is an option to enter a date for the last Fiscal Year End for the Existing Company. If the Fiscal Year End Date is different than the Effective Date, there is an adjustment option in both the Asset and Debt Input pages that would allow amounts to be entered that would adjust the beginning Balance Sheet from the Fiscal Year End to the Effective Date. All beginning Asset and Debt amounts need to be as of the Effective Date making it much simpler to have the Effective Date be the same as the Fiscal Year End.
For the Target Company, there is no option for entering a Fiscal Year End, so the Effective Date in Step 2 should be the Date for all beginning Assets and Debt amounts for the Target Company.
