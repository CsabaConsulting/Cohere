# Transaction Costs - Capitalized Acquisition Costs
## Category: Assets
Capitalized Acquisition Costs are the costs associated with the purchase of the Company such as legal expense, due diligence expense (the expenses for investigating the purchase of the Company prior to the purchase) and new entity set up fees. These expenses, although paid in cash at the time of the Company purchase, will be "Capitalized" and become an asset on the Balance Sheet that will be expensed over time (amortized) instead of being an expense in the year that it was paid.
For Hard Asset Value considerations, the "value" of the Capitalized Acquisition Costs will not be used as it is not considered a Hard Asset recoverable in a net asset liquidation of the company.
