# Company Purchase Funding Source
## Category: Transaction Details
For the debts on the Transaction Sheet, the question, "Will this loan be funded at Close of Escrow or as of the Effective Date?" is asked upon debt detail input.
If Yes is selected, the funds from the loan will be available as cash flow for the Close of Escrow and become part of the capital used to purchase the Company and provide the beginning Working Capital.
If No is selected, the loan will not be funded during the Close of Escrow, however the terms as entered in the Debt setup will apply for the future.
