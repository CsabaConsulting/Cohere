# Seller Retained Assets
## Category: Transaction Details
This is an optional input found in Step 4 when entering the Purchase Price for the Company . This input pertains to a situation where the Seller will be retaining ownership of assets that are normally included in the value indicated. This may also become useful when the Buyer is not able to offer the Seller the Sellers desired sale price or there is an disagreement between the value of the asset to the Seller and the value to the Buyer. With this option, the Seller may retain the value of certain assets of the Company and lease them back to the Company after the Company is sold. In this manner, the Buyer can agree to a lease rate that is commensurate with the assets contribution value.
The Seller Retained Assets will be subtracted from the Value indicated. The full value can be used as the Company value and the amount indicated with this Input will reduce the value by the amount retained by the Seller. In the Debt Input section, there is a provision to lease assets back from the Seller if applicable. By including the Seller assets in the gross value and then subtracting them out, the Buyers and Sellers Sale Statement on the Transaction Sheet will reflect the full benefit of the business value plus the retained assets to the Seller.
This option only applies in certain circumstances and the Seller Retained Assets Input may be left blank if this option is not desired.
