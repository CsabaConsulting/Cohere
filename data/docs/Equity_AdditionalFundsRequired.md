# Additional Funds Required
## Category: Equity
When the Transaction Deal Structure does not provide the required amount of capital either through Debt or Equity, there will be an "Additional Funds Required" amount shown on the Transaction Sheet Deal Structure. If the Equity holders in the Deal own 100% of the equity of the post closing company (Step 8), the additional funds required will flow to the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet as assumed equity provided and will be shown in a separate line of the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet as "Additional Funds Required".
If the Equity holders in the Deal are not purchasing 100% of the equity of the post closing company (Step 8), i.e. they are only purchasing a portion of the Company, the additional funds required will not flow to the Equity Section of the Balance Sheet as the post closing Balance Sheet represents 100 % of the Company. Because the purchase is less than 100% of the Company, the Deal Transaction is between the old equity holders and the new equity holders and will occur outside the Company's post closing balance sheet. Therefore the "Additional Funds Required" is only for information purposes.
