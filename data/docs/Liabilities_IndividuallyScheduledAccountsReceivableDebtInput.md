# Individually Scheduled Accounts Receivable Debt Input
## Category: Liabilities
The total of the Individually Scheduled Debts listed in these forms will be sent to either the Transaction Sheet or the Existing Company (Location) as indicated by the User Inputs.
After the Effective Date, these loans will be rolled into one Line of Credit at each Location. Each Location will have one average Interest Rate, Loan to Value and Ineligible percentage. The inclusion of separate individual loans in the Individual Item Schedule is only intended to provide the User a detail of the consolidation of a number of Items into one Line of Credit.
See Accounts Receivable  - Future Terms Set-Up  for the inputs that will apply to the future line of credit.
The separate Loan to Value and Ineligible Inputs are for information purposes only in order to provide the Weighted Average calculations as a guide for the Inputs for the Future line of credit.
