# Historical Worksheet
## Category: Summary
The Historical Worksheet is a tool for the User to input historical performance in the same format that is requested by the *ThruThink* analysis and assist the User in making sound projections based on historical performance.
The Historical Worksheet is a stand alone analysis for the convenience of the User and will not affect the calculations in the *ThruThink *analysis.
There are several calculation results identified with a box outline that show an example of a result that is requested in the *ThruThink* analysis in the Sales/EBITDA Input page and the Accounts Payable Future Terms Set-Up page. Numbers identified on the Historical Worksheet may be helpful to guide inputs requested in those forms.
### Use Worksheet Projections for Cash Flow Control
Even though the Historical Worksheet is a stand alone tool, the User may choose to use the Worksheet projections for the projections in the Cash Flow Control page which are the projections used in the *ThruThink* analysis.
There is an input option that is available on the lower portion of the Historical Worksheet Input page that will incorporate the Worksheet projections into the *ThruThink* analysis.
The Company sales total will be adjusted in the Sales Override Inputs on the Cash Flow Control page.
Company COGS % of Sales will be adjusted in the COGS Percent of Sales Override Inputs on the Cash Flow Control page.
The Company Operating Expense projections total will entered into the Cash Flow Operating Expense Input page which will show up on the Cash Flow Control page under Adjustments to Operating Expense.
An adjustment will be made in the Scheduled Income/Expense page to zero out the effect of any inputs on those pages.
**Please Note-These projection adjustments will replace any manual override inputs made by the User in the Cash Flow Control to Sales Override and the COGS Percent of Sales Override. These original override inputs by the User will be lost. Pressing the Clear button, will not restore the manual User inputs for these items. This will  effect only the manual User inputs for those items on the Cash Flow Control  but will not effect any Step 3 User inputs.**
