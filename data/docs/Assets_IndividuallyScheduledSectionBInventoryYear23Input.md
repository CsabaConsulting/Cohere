# Individually Scheduled Section B Inventory Year 2-3 Input
## Category: Assets
This inventory was created from Capitalized Expenses in Section C from the prior year Individually Scheduled Expense inputs. This will indicate when this inventory is to be used during the year.
This information is simply a allocated spread of the totals indicated.
For every entry for Year 2-3 Section B Inventory, the User must make an entry for the Sale Value of the Inventory used. This is the value for which the Inventory being taken out of inventory and used will be sold. Each time an entry is made on this page, the User will be prompted for the Sale Value. If there is an existing Sale Value for this item, it will be shown on the prompt and the User may change or accept that amount. If there will be no Sale Value for the Inventory used, a '0' must be entered for the Sale Value. Each individual input for Sale Value on this page will flow to the Individually Scheduled Section D Income.
