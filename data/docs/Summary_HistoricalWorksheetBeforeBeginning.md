# Historical Worksheet - Before Beginning
## Category: Summary
The *ThruThink* analysis illustrates the projected performance of a business in concert with its debt and equity structure.
Before beginning the Input Process (Step Process), if there are historical operating results for the Company available, this information should be entered into the Historical Worksheet in the *ThruThink* analysis. If this is done prior to the input process, it will be helpful to the User in making some of the input decisions and lay out a basis of comparison in a similar format as the *ThruThink* analysis.
The *ThruThink Evaluation* is for the "business deal" and uses information from the Historical Worksheet. The Evaluation and Deal Score will not be complete unless the historical information is provided.
