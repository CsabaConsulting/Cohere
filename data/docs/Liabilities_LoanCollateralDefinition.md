# Loan Collateral Definition
## Category: Liabilities
Collateral is the asset that is pledged to the Lender to serve as security for the loan also referred to as Loan Security. The loan is generally a percentage of the value of the Collateral (Loan to Value Ratio) in order to allow a recovery margin in the case the lender must recover the Collateral to pay off the loan.
The Lender will usually file a Security Agreement of some type with the appropriate government jurisdiction that will secure the asset as security for the Lender. This will usually create a lien or legal encumbrance against the asset.
