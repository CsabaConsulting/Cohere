# EBIT Definition
## Category: Summary
EBIT stands for Earnings before Interest and Taxes and is derived using EBITDA and subtracting annual depreciation and amortization.
In *ThruThink*, EBIT is only used as a part of the EBIT/Total Assets measure. For that measure, since Total Assets have been reduced by accumulated depreciation/amortization, using EBITDA which is before the Depreciation/Amortization expense deduction is inconsistent, therefore EBIT is more appropriate.
