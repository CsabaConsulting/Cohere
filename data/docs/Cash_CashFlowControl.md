# Cash Flow Control
## Category: Cash
The Cash Flow Control page lays out the Cash Flow for Horizon Years chosen by the User. This form reflects the cash flow results from the User Inputs from the Step Process. If those inputs are satisfactory, no additional input on this form is required.
The rows with yellow input boxes are available for the User to make manual adjustments or additional inputs. The Cash Flow Input page is dynamic which means the User may scroll the page and watch the effect on the page as the adjustments are entered. In this manner, as adjustments for Sales, COGS, Overhead Expenses, Debt payments, Capital Expenditures and non business cash payments are entered, the effect on the annual and cumulative Cash Balance listed both at the Top and Bottom of the page can be observed.
The page provides the ability to manage cash by making extra debt pay downs or drawing on loans as cash flow dictates and allows.
The income tax expense will reflect the Inputs made by the User which may be observed on the Cash Flow Control page.
