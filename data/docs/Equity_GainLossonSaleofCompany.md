# Gain/Loss on Sale of Company
## Category: Equity
A Gain or Loss on the Sale of the Company is calculated in *ThruThink* by using the Exit Sale input as a Market Value or if no Exit Input was made in Step 7, the Hard Asset Value of the Company at the end of the Horizon Period, see Information Browser - Exit Calculations for specific detail.
By default, an Equity Member will receive the same Gain/Loss percentage as their Equity percentage. However, an Equity Member may receive a different percentage of the Gain/Loss from the Company Sale from that of the Equity Members Equity percentage by using an override input in Step 8. This is intended to provide an incentive to specific equity holders (ex.management or Investors) that pays off on the Sale of the Company. A Capital Gain tax calculation (See Step 7 - Tax Rates for Capital Gain Tax input) is used only for the ThruThink Evaluation and the Equity Return calculations. There are no other tax attributes for this included in the *ThruThink* analysis, see Information Browser - Exit Calculations for specific detail of tax calculations.
Beware that a Loss on Sale of the Company will also be passed to the Equity Member in accordance with their Gain/Loss Percentage.
