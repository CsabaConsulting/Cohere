# EBITDA Definition
## Category: EBITDA
Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) reflects the Company's operating performance prior to the effect of interest, taxes and non cash expenses of depreciation and amortization and is commonly used as a measure of a Company's true performance from its operations.
Because interest is often a factor of the debt structure that is a separate (but related) issue from the earnings capability of the Company, taxes are assumed to be driven from the earnings of the Company and not part of the operations and depreciation and amortization are non cash expenses and at best, a guess as to the actual loss in value of fixed assets over time and use, EBITDA becomes a good indication of earnings from operations of the Company.
For Companies with a substantial investment in highly actual depreciable assets, care should be used to make sure that expenses for repairs reflect an appropriate amount to keep the assets in good condition and Capital Expenditures (CapEx) should be included in the Cash Flow Control Input area to represent an adequate asset replacement schedule. The assumption is that between the repair expense and the CapEx, the contribution value of the assets to operating earnings are maintained or improved.
