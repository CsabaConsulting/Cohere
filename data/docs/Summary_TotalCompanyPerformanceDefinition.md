# Total Company Performance Definition
## Category: Summary
The measure of Total Company Performance will be for the Company itself from operations and the Exit Sale if applicable. It will reflect the Equity Note payments to the Equity Partners as arms length outside debts. Any Performance Earn Out amount paid to the Seller who may be an Equity Partner is reflected as it would be for a non Equity Partner Seller transaction. Equity Draws do not effect the measure of Company Performance unless noted otherwise.
