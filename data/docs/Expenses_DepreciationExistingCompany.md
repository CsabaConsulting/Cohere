# Depreciation-Existing Company
## Category: Expenses
For the existing Company assets, the future depreciation expenses are manual input numbers entered by the User as future Existing Company Depreciation Expense Inputs and not calculated from the asset values themselves.
Depreciation expenses entered for future years for each asset category must be less than or equal to the asset category net value entered on the initial Existing Company Balance Sheet. Depreciation expense inputs for a given asset category whose sum exceeds the asset category value will cause an error and not be allowed.
