# Sales Projection Inputs
## Category: Income
The current level of Sales for the Company is entered in Step 3. It is important to complete the Base Sales in Step 3 as that information will also be used as part of the Deal Evaluation process.
There are three ways of entering future Sales:
1. A % change for Sales for each of years 1-3 and a percent for all years after Year 3 can be entered on the Step 3 Sales and EBITDA Input page. This is a quick and less time consuming method of entering future Sales and is done while entering Base Sales and or Base EBITDA Inputs in Step 3.
2. A % change for Sales for each year for each of the Horizon Years can also be entered on the Cash Flow Control page. These entries will override any conflicting entries made on the Sales and EBITDA page in Step 3 and can be used to adjust the Sales projections. This is done while reviewing the Cash Flow results on the Cash Flow Control page and is a good method to adjust Expenses while being able to see the resulting financial impact.
3. For more detailed Sales inputs the Individual Scheduled Item pages may be used to input individual income projections in detail. This method is useful when specific detailed income projections are necessary. Inputs may be made in the form of Units and $/Unit for these inputs.
