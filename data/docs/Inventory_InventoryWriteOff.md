# Inventory Write Off
## Category: Inventory
At times it may become necessary to remove a certain amount of Inventory that have become unusable.
In some businesses, there may be the need to have a standard allowance for this on an annual basis or on a multi-year basis (such as every other year). This is a non essential voluntary input option.
The write off amount will reduce the Inventory and increase expense at the end of the year of the write off.
This option is found in the Inventory  - Future Terms Set-Up  Input Page.
