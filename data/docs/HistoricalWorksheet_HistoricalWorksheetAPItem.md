# Historical Worksheet - A/P Item
## Category: Historical Worksheet
On the Historical Worksheet, the User may designate each expense item as an Accounts Payable (A/P) type item by entering YES or No by the item in the A/P column. An A/P type item is an item that for cash flow purposes can be paid in accordance with the A/P terms of 30, 60, etc days to pay. The purpose of this is to give the User an idea of the % of A/P type items in the total expenses. This % can be used in setting up the Accounts Payable - Future Terms Set-Up in the *ThruThink* application (See Information Browser). An example of an item that would not be treated as an A/P type item is Labor.
Enter Yes for items that can be paid over seven days later.
