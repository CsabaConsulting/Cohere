# Restructure or Adjustment Process
## Category: Balance Sheet
The Restructure Process is only used with the Existing Company and allows the User to represent an item on the original Existing Company Balance Sheet and then "restructure" the item on the balance sheet before the Effective Date. It is intended that this be matched by a corresponding Adjustment addition to the Balance Sheet using one of the Individually Scheduled  Debt or Asset Item Inputs making the "Existing Company-Adjustment" Show On selection for that item which will then cause the Adjustment addition to show up in the "Adjustment Column" on the Existing Company Balance Sheet. This will take place before the Effective Date or before closing of escrow. This is simply to show a "detail trail" for pre Effective Date adjustments or restructures. The Adjusted Balances are the only ones subsequently used in the analysis.
The primary function for this process is intended to illustrate a "Restructure Plan" of Short Term Debt, i.e. A/R, Inventory or Other Current Debt to Long Term Debt in order to increase Working Capital.
