# Asset Inputs
## Category: Assets
The User may identify and list separately up to four different types, categories or groups for both A/R and Inventory.
Examples of A/R groups would be Due in 30 Days, Due in 60 Days, etc.
Examples of Inventory groups would be Finished Goods, Work in Process, Raw Ingredients.
The Days to Collect for A/R are the Weeks for each category of Accounts Receivable until the category is collected. The Weeks to Hold for Inventory are the average Weeks to hold before use for each category of Inventory.
After the User Inputs are made for the A/R and Inventory, the calculated weighted average for the total Weeks for each will be shown on the form. Use this information to complete the Future Years input form for the Weeks to Collect the A/R and the Weeks to Hold for Inventory in future years.
For Other Current Assets, Equipment, Buildings/Improvements, Real Estate, Other Long Term Assets and Goodwill, the User will enter the totals for each.
The Adjustment Inputs for the Existing Company Assets may be used to make adjustments or reorganizations of the Asset Items. This Input can be used to add amounts to adjust the Asset Item to reflect activity to a future date, such as the effective date for the Purchase of the Company.
