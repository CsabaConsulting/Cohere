# Cost of Goods Sold Inputs
## Category: Expenses
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) items can be entered by the User in four different ways:
1. A Percent of Sales in Step 3
2. A Cash Flow Control page override adjustment as a Percent of Sales input. The % of Sales for COGS entered in the Cash Flow Control page will override the Step 3 % inputs.
3. A Cash Flow Control page override adjustment as a Whole Number input. A Whole Number input for COGS on the Cash Flow Control form will override both the Step 3 and Cash Flow Control % COGS inputs.
4. Individually Identified Items. For the Years 1-3, the detail for specific Individually Scheduled COGS can be entered in the Individually Scheduled COGS Input page for each of Years 1-3. The balance of the Horizon Years will use the same input as Year 3 unless overridden with an individual input for the total of the Individual Identified Items in any of the applicable Horizon Years . This is intended to use Years 1-3 to set a pattern. Individually Identified COGS will be separate and in addition to any % of Sales or Whole Number COGS inputs.
