# Machinery & Equipment Debt Repayment-Transaction Sheet
## Category: Liabilities
Annual Payments on the Transaction Sheet Equipment Debt will be the interest on the outstanding balance of the loan at the prior year end plus principal. The amount of the Principal is calculated by dividing 1 by the remaining years of the loan. Example:
10 year Loan:
* Year 1 principal repayment will be 1/10 or 10%
* Year 2 principal repayment will be 1/9 or 11.1%
* Year 3 principal repayment will be 1/8 or 12.5%
There is a provision in the Cash Flow Control that allows the User to be able to increase the loan (or additional payments) during the life of the original life of the loan. When an advance on the loan is made after the original loan is made, the loan duration is reset to the original term. Because of this the principal repayment calculation floats with the remaining years of the loan.
The provision of additional advances and payments is reflective of a Line of Credit situation that provides the ability to make additional advances and paybacks.  It also allows the User the flexibility and cash flow insight to adjust the loan amounts as Cash Flow indicates and test different scenarios in future years.
In all cases, if a Balloon Year is indicated by the User, the remaining balance of the loan is paid off in the Balloon Year. This will include advances that may have been made only the year before.
If other principal repayment options including amortized, level principal, monthly payments, quarterly payments, etc are required by the User, the Individually Scheduled Item Input option should be used.
