## Category: Interest
Interest expense for a given year is the Interest Rate as indicated in the initial debt setup multiplied by the principal balance of the loan at the beginning of the year and is shown as an accrued interest expense for that year.
Interest paid in a given year is calculated using the Interest Rate as indicated in the initial debt setup multiplied by the principal balance of the loan, as adjusted by additional AJE or Cash Flow Control adjustments to the principal, at the end of the previous year.
Accrued Interest Expense will be adjusted accordingly by any AJE's made directly to Accrued Interest Expense or by any AJE's or Cash Flow Control page adjustments made to the principal amount of the loan in the prior period.
### Accrued Interest Liability
The beginning Balance for Accrued Interest Liability is entered with the Existing Company beginning debt in Step 6.
An Accrued Interest Liability can be generated automatically for some of the Debt accounts when interest is not automatically paid each year. Other Current Debt and Seller Debt are two such debts. General adjustments to Accrued Interest Liability may be made with an AJE (Debit/Credit) to the individual Debts that have separate Accrued Interest Liability accounts or to a general Other Accrued Interest Liability.
Direct payments to Accrued Interest Liability is made with an AJE (debit), (see Step 7 - Adjusting Journal Entries). When Accrued Interest is paid with an AJE, it becomes a cash payment and that amount is included with the Regular Interest paid. Accrued Interest liability for a particular debt whether or not created with an AJE, will be paid down by additional payments for that debt in the Cash Flow Control page.
