# Amortization-Existing Company
## Category: Expenses
For the existing Company Amortized Asset Category, the future amortization expense is a manual input number entered by the User as a future Existing Company Amortization Expense Input and not calculated from the beginning asset value itself.
Amortization expense entered for future years for the Amortized Asset category must be less than or equal to the asset category net value entered on the initial Existing Company Balance Sheet. Amortization expense input whose sum exceeds the asset category value will cause an error and not be allowed.
