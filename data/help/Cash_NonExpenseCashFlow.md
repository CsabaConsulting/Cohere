# Non Expense Cash Flow
## Category: Cash
As used in the *ThruThink* analysis, Non Expense Cash Flow refers to two separate items: (1) the Non Expense Cash Flow items coming from the AJE process that are not accounted for individually such as AJE's for principal payments on debt, etc. This Non Expense Cash Flow from the AJE's will flow to the Cash Flow Control and the Sources and Uses of Cash to be represented as cash flow requirements, (2) the Non Expense Cash Flow Items coming from the Non Cash Input page that can be used for Draws and Contributions.
### Non Expense Cash Flow Input
Non Expense Cash Flow is any use of Company cash for non Company purposes. This use of cash is considered a Draw on Owners Equity and will simultaneously reduce the Company's Cash and Owners Equity.
Draws will not effect the Income/Expense and is not deducted for tax calculations.
When there is more than one Owner, the Draws will be allocated to each owner in the percentage of their Owners Equity. Draws to only one owner are not allowed.
A cash contribution may be made by entering a negative number. This will add to the Company's cash and increase the Owners Equity in the same percentage as each owners equity ownership.
Non Expense Cash Flow Items are entered by the User through the Non Expense Cash Flow Input page or through an AJE entry.
