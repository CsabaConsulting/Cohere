# Other Transaction Debt Priority
## Category: Liabilities
There are three available items for the initial Other Transaction Debt. The User should input the most important item as Loan # 1 and for # 2 and 3 in order of importance. Beyond the regular payments identified for each debt, any adjustments made on the Cash Flow Control page to this category of loans will be applied to the first Loan item and then when paid off, then to the second, etc. Any draws made on the Cash Flow Control page to this category of loans will be applied to the first item only. In this instance, the same payments will be made as identified for each debt, and the remaining balance at the end of the term identified for each debt will be paid off in a balloon payment. A Cash Flow adjustment or AJE that creates a negative loan amount will not be allowed. If a draw or AJE is made for a period after the loan term is expired and the original loan has been paid off, the amount of the Cash Flow adjustment or AJE will create a loan balance until adjusted again with either a Cash Flow Sheet adjustment or another AJE. Interest will be paid on the balance annually until paid off with either another Cash Flow page adjustment or AJE.
If individual activity (Payment or Draw) is needed for each item separately, an AJE may be made to each specific item.
