# Accrued Interest Liability
## Category: Liabilities
The beginning Balance for Accrued Interest Liability is entered with the Existing Company beginning debt in Step 6.
An Accrued Interest Liability can be generated automatically for some of the Debt accounts when interest is not automatically paid each year. Other Current Debt and Seller Debt are two such debts. General adjustments to Accrued Interest Liability may be made with an AJE (Debit/Credit) to the individual Debts that have separate Accrued Interest Liability accounts or to a general Other Accrued Interest Liability.
Direct payments to Accrued Interest Liability is made with an AJE (debit), (see Step 7 - Adjusting Journal Entries). When Accrued Interest is paid with an AJE, it becomes a cash payment and that amount is included with the Regular Interest paid. Accrued Interest liability for a particular debt whether or not created with an AJE, will be paid down by additional payments for that debt in the Cash Flow Control page.
