# Surplus Equity Funds
## Category: Transaction Details
When more funds are provided thru the debt and equity contributions in the Transaction Sheet than is required for the Transaction, the amount over that required for the Transaction will be deemed Surplus Funds.
Surplus Funds can be created in the Transaction from either new debt or cash equity contributions generated for the Transaction or pre-existing debt assumed from the Seller that is being used in the Transaction.
Surplus Funds created from new debt or equity contributions will be considered distributed during the acquisition escrow to the Equity Groups in the percentage of their equity contributions or in the case of no equity contributions, their equity ownership in the Company and reflected as an Equity distribution in the Equity Section of the post closing beginning Balance Sheet.
If there are Surplus Funds, the IRR/MIRR calculations will default to "0" as there is no investment on which to calculate a return.
