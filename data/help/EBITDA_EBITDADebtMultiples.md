# EBITDA Debt Multiples
## Category: EBITDA
Debt measured as a multiple of Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) is a method of putting the debt level of the Company in perspective with its earnings (expressed as EBITDA).
The amount of an acceptable EBITDA debt multiple will depend on a number of factors, one of which is the trend factor in EBITDA growth. A high confidence in EBITDA growth will justify a higher EBITDA Debt Multiple. Conversely, a lower confidence in EBITDA growth or a negative EBITDA growth history will indicate a lower level of acceptable EBITDA Debt Multiple.
For information reference purposes, a maximum Senior and Sub Debt EBITDA Multiple Goal may be entered through the Transaction Sheet Sub Debt Input page. This does not effect any calculations, but simply provides a point of reference on the EBITDA Multiple page and the Transaction Deal Structure page.
