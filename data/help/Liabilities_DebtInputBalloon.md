# Debt Input-Balloon
## Category: Liabilities
A Balloon is when the loan matures (becomes due) prior to the end of the term indicated. In this case, the term is used to determine the amount of the loan paid back each year, but the Balloon Year will determine when the loan becomes due. The remaining balance on the loan is due at the end of the Balloon Year. For the Balloon Year to have any effect it must be less than Term of the loan. Example: a 30 year loan has a Balloon in 10 years, means that the loan payments are as if it were a 30 year loan, but the loan actually is due in 10 years.
