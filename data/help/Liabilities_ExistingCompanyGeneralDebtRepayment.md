# Existing Company General Debt Repayment
## Category: Liabilities
For the General Debt Input, each category will have separate repayment processes as follows:
The Accounts Payable will be paid in accordance with the Future Terms Set-Up inputs for Accounts Payable.
The initial Beginning Accrued Interest (as of the date of the Existing Company balance sheet) will be automatically paid the following year. Continuing Accrued Interest can be managed through the AJE process with an Other Interest Accrual AJE.
The General A/R Debt will be combined with any other A/R Debt inputted elsewhere and paid in accordance with the Accounts Receivable Future Terms Set-Up inputs for the Accounts Receivable Line of Credit.
The General Inventory Debt will be combined with any other Inventory Debt inputted elsewhere and paid in accordance with the Inventory Future Terms Set-Up inputs for the Inventory Line of Credit.
Other Current Debt is considered short term due to be paid within 12 months and can be reported with two methods. A general category can be reported for the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company and more specific information may be entered with the Individually Scheduled Other Current Debt process. For more detail, see Help Browser, Other Current Debt.
The General Other Current Debt can be governed by a Credit Limit input. If there is a Credit Limit entered by the User, for years 1-3, there is an automatic Draw or Payment feature. In addition to the automatic feature in years 1-3 and for years after year 3, Draws and Payments can be made using the Cash Flow Control page as well as the Adjusting Journal Entry features.
The Other Long Term Debt has no automatic repayment process and the balance will remain until changed through the AJE process.
The Deferred Tax Liability has no automatic repayment process and the balance will remain until changed through the AJE process.
