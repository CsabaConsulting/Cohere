# Inventory
## Category: Inventory
Inventory is unused material and supplies used to create finished product as well as unsold finished product.
Inventory includes Work in Process which will include allocated manufacturing labor as well as the direct materials and supplies of unfinished Finished Product.
Unsold completed Finished Product Inventory includes allocated direct manufacturing labor as well as the direct materials and supplies.
Cash paid to create inventory (see Inventory - Future Terms Set-up) or User capitalized expenses (see Info Browser - Individually Scheduled Income/Expense, Capitalized Expenses) is counted as an Inventory Asset and not counted as an Expense in either the ThruThink Accrual or Cash Basis method of accounting (see Info Browser - Tax Rates). Therefore when the User chooses the ThruThink Cash Basis for calculation of income taxes, cash paid for inventory will not be counted as an expense for income tax purposes.
### Inventory Replenish
When Inventory is written off, including the Initial Inventory at the time of Company acquisition, the User can specify how much should be replenished the next year and how many weeks it should take to replenish.
The Year 0 Inputs pertain to the Initial Inventory write off at the time of Company Acquisition (See Asset Input page).
For the Weeks to replenish, enter a whole number between 0 and 52. Specific calculations only are made for years 1-3. Week to Week calculations are only made for Years 1-3.
The Inventory replenish amount is in addition to the normal amount of inventory being generated for the current year sales therefore there it causes a greater demand on cash flow. The greater amount to replenish and the shorter time desired, the greater impact on cash flow requirements.
### COGS to be Inventoried
Generally when a product is manufactured or purchased for resale, the cost of the item will be put into inventory as an asset. When the item is then sold,  or combined with other items and sold, the cost of the item(s) will be taken out of inventory and expensed as a part of Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).
The total COGS for the item sold however will also contain other costs that are incurred at the time of sale such as packaging, shipping etc. The percent of COGS to be inventoried therefore is the percent of the total COGS that are expenses purchased for inventory to be used at a later date.
