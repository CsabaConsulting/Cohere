# Projection to Actual Comparison
## Category: Projection to Actual
During the first year of the Projection Time Horizon, the User may compare the Projections to actual results for either This Year or Last Year.
Actuals may be entered for each month of Last Year and This Year for comparison purposes. The User should enter each month for Last Year and the applicable months for This Year by using the Month ID for Actual Inputs on the Projection to Actuals page.
The Month ID for the Actual inputs is independent of the Month ID for Comparison. Actuals are entered into the appropriate period using the Month ID for Actuals. A comparison between the Projections and either Last Year or This Year can be made, however, when a comparison is made for either the Month or Year to Date, the Month ID for Comparison and the Month ID for Actuals must be for the same period.
A spread of the months activity for the annual Projections for Year 1, Last Year Actuals, This Year Actuals and the Actual to Date and Projections for the balance of the Year can be viewed and printed from their respective tabs on the Projection to Actual page.
