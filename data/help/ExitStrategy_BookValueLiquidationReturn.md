# Book Value Liquidation - Return
## Category: Exit Strategy
Book Value Liquidation is defined as a Company Sale at Book Value for all of the assets less the total liabilities on the Balance Sheet of the Company at the end of any given period. In this manner, assets are listed at cost less depreciation and will include all non cash assets such as Capitalized Goodwill (the amount over hard value of assets paid for the Company) and other Amortized Assets.
Book Value of an individual asset or asset category is the original cost of the asset or assets in the category less the accumulated depreciation or amortization expense for that individual asset or asset category.
