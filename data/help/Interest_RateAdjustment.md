# Rate Adjustment
## Category: Interest
Rate Adjustment is the option to increase the Interest Rate at a certain Point in the future. This is used with the Seller Note as the Seller Note can be Interest Only or Amortized (loan is paid off over the term of the Note). If the Seller Note is set to Interest Only, the Rate Adjustment could be set prior to the end of the Term to provide incentive to pay the Note off before the end of the Term.
