# Accounts Receivable and Inventory Write Off
## Category: Expenses
At times it may become necessary to remove a certain amount of Accounts Receivables and Inventories that have become uncollectable as in A/R or unusable as in Inventory.
In some businesses, there may be the need to have a standard allowance for this on an annual basis or on a multi-year basis (such as every other year). This is a non essential voluntary input option.
The write off amount will reduce the A/R or Inventory and increase expense at the end of the year of the write off.
