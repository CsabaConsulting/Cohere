# Cost of Goods Sold to be Inventoried
## Category: Expenses
Generally when a product is manufactured or purchased for resale, the cost of the item will be put into inventory as an asset. When the item is then sold, or combined with other items and sold, the cost of the item(s) will be taken out of inventory and expensed as a part of Cost of Goods Sold (COGS).
The total COGS for the item sold however will also contain other costs that are incurred at the time of sale such as packaging, shipping etc. The percent of COGS to be inventoried therefore is the percent of the total COGS that are expenses purchased for inventory to be used at a later date.
