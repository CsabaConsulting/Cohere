# Real Property Assets
## Category: Assets
In a Company purchase, are there any real estate, buildings, improvements or fixed in place equipment (Real Property) that the Company will require and not be purchased as part of the Company sale. This is often the buildings and real estate that the Seller or another party will continue to own after the sale of the Company or that the Company will lease from another party.
Very often the value of a Company can be looked at as if there are two types of assets, real estate (including buildings) and the business operations.
A Company purchase includes the value of the "operation", but can very often not include the Real Property. In the case of the latter, the Company can be moved to a new location or the new owner can lease the Real Property from the Seller.
In either case, if these assets materially contribute to the operations of the Company, a lease expense for the Real Property that the Seller will retain should be added to the Company's expenses to represent the value of these assets. An input for this purpose is available in Step 7.
Personal property is considered movable equipment and real property is fixed equipment, real estate, buildings and improvements.
Often, the definition between some assets as real property or personal property become becomes somewhat vague. Many taxing authorities apply property taxes differently between the two categories.
For the purposes of the *ThruThink* analysis, Real Property is fixed permanent assets such as Real Estate, Buildings and Improvements.
