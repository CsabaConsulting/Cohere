# Inventory Weeks to Hold
## Category: Assets
### Beginning Inventory
This is the average time over which the Inventory will be held for use. Use will be evenly over this time. This will apply to Beginning Inventory balances only, after which, the input for Future Ave Weeks to Hold will be used for the Horizon Years. If there is no selection for the future years, the default for future years will be the selection indicated for the initial inputs on the Transaction Sheet. If this is left blank, 0 will be used and no inventory will be held for use.
If the Existing Company is purchasing the Target Company, for Year 1, a weighted average will be calculated between the Weeks to Hold listed on the Transaction Sheet for the Target Company and the Weeks to Hold listed for the initial input for the Existing Company. For Years after Year 1, the selections in the Ave Weeks to Hold in the Future Input will be used with no weighted average calculation. If there is no selection indicated in the Transaction Sheet, the initial input for the Existing Company will be used for future years.
This Input is found in the Inventory Set Up pages for the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company Inventory Beginning Balances.
