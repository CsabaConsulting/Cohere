# ThruThink Deal Score and ThruThink Evaluation
## Category: Summary
The *ThruThink Deal Score* is an optional User selection. It is turned off by default and must be turned on by the User in the Workflow menu, Step 7, by clicking the button for *ThruThink Evaluation* inputs and choosing "Yes".
The *ThruThink Deal Score* provides an "A", "B", "C", "D" or "F" rating of the Deal with "A" being the highest rating. The rating evaluates the Deal or comparative benefit to the Owner as presented by the User Inputs. It is not necessarily a score for the quality of the Company itself. In other words, an excellent Company can receive a poor Deal Score and Evaluation because of improper capital structure, Owner Draws, etc.
The *ThruThink Evaluation* is used by the *ThruThink Deal Score* however it is not affected by turning the *ThruThink Deal Score* on or off.
*ThruThink Deal Score and the ThruThink Evaluation are registered Service Marks with the United States Patent Office and are services that use proprietary processes of formulas, algorithms and measurements of business performance.*

### Risk Rating
The Risk Rating uses a Modified Internal Rate of Return (See, Help Browser - MIRR, for definition) with Beginning Total Assets as the initial cash outlay with no debt used in the Deal. Projected EBITDA adjusted by cash flow impact of receivables, inventory and A/P along with an income tax estimate as well as annual equity draws or contributions. The Market Value of the deal or Company after a Long Term Capital Gain tax deduction, without the Liabilities of the Company at the end of the earlier of 10 years or the Horizon Years is used as the cash return at the end of the investment. If a Market Value is not provided by the User, a Hard Asset Value (w/o amortized assets such as goodwill) liquidation of the assets will be used instead.
This is then factored by a Confidence factor based on the historical EBITDA. If there is limited historical information, the Confidence factor will be low which will substantially effect the Risk Rating. This is further factored by a comparison with the current yield of 10 Year United States Treasury Notes.
The *ThruThink Evaluation* evaluates only the first 10 years of a deal and will use the Hard Asset liquidation value as the Exit Value at year 10, if there is not a Market Value available. The Exit Value may be entered for only the end of the Horizon time period, however for Horizon time periods over 10 years, for the *ThruThink Evaluation*, the User should be sure to at least enter an appropriate Exit Value for Year 10 as well as the end of the Horizon time period.
### Confidence Level
The level of confidence is a *ThruThink* proprietary calculation on a scale of 1-100 (1 being low), that is given for the future  projections for EBITDA as they relate to historical EBITDA actual performance.
The confidence in the future performance should always be taken into account when considering the IRR results. This is a measure of such confidence, however future performance can not always be predicted by historical activity.
### Cash Flow Characteristics
Cash Flow Characteristics reflects Beginning Cash Balance and how steady or erratic the projected Cumulative Cash Balance is over the Horizon Years and if the Cumulative Cash Flow becomes negative within the Horizon Years (the scope is limited to the Horizon Years or 10 Years which ever is less). If the Cumulative Cash flow becomes negative indicating the Company runs out of money, there is an automatic negative score given for Cash Flow Characteristics. The measured Cash Flow is the final annual cash flow of the Company after Debt payments, Income Taxes, Capital Expenditures (Sales) and Owner Draws.
### Stability of Projections
This reflects how representative is the first three years projection for EBITDA compared with the historic EBITDA performance. No historical performance will cause a zero score. A negative historical trend for EBITDA will detract from the score.
### EBITDA to Sales Ratio
This reflects the historical EBITDA/Sales ratio, the current EBITDA Ratio and the ratio through the Year 3 projection with a factor for stability and consistency of the numbers. No historical data available will substantially reduce the EBITDA to Sales Ratio score (See Risk Rating).
### EBITDA to Debt Ratio
This reflects the beginning EBITDA/Total Debt ratio. Generally, an EBITDA/Total Debt ratio of between 0 and 3 is considered Excellent to Good. Over 3 to 5 Good to Marginal and a ratio of 5 or over is considered Excessive and negative.
### EBIT to Total Assets
This reflects earnings as a percent of total assets deployed. This is a good measure of putting the level of earnings in perspective with the amount of total assets involved.
### Working Capital
Working Capital is the difference between Current Assets and Current Liabilities. Current Assets means all assets that are cash or will turn to cash within 12 months of the particular date being considered. Current Liabilities means all Debts that are due to be paid within 12 months of the date being considered. The Current Liabilities should include the Current Portion of Long Term Debt which is the portion of the long term debt that will be due in payments over the next 12 months.
The score considers the Beginning Working Capital along with the Working Capital for year 1-3, however it places a greater weight on the Beginning Working Capital.
### Net Total Debt
Net Debt is used to consider leverage or the amount of debt in a Company or Deal. In the *ThruThink* analysis, Net Debt is Total Debt less Cash and Accounts Receivable. The effect of leverage or debt on a Company or Deal is expressed by the ratio of Net Debt to Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA).
### Net Income
This will reflect Net Income along with its variability and trend over the Horizon Years.
### Quality of Non Owner Management
This is a direct input by the User. On a 1 to 10 basis (1 being no involvement), how independent is the Management of the Company from the Owner. How much technical, financial or operational involvement is materially or uniquely provided by the Owner. This should involve both compensated and Un-Compensated contribution of the Owner. This score should also reflect the overall capability of the Management separate from the Owner.
### Amount of Un-Compensated Owner Contribution
This is a direct input by the User. On an annual basis, how much necessary and material involvement of the Owner is Un-Compensated. This should be only that contribution which would need to be replaced if the Owner were not there. The amount should be that amount that would be required for an outside party to provide similar contribution. The score reflects the amount of Un-Compensated Owner Contribution as compared with the Beginning EBITDA.
### Liquidity of the Business
This is a direct input by the User and is an estimate for how many months it would take to sell the Company. Generally this can be from 5 to 36 months.
