# Historical Worksheet - Expenses as a Percent of Sales
## Category: Historical Worksheet
On the Historical Worksheet, for Cost of Goods Sold and Operating Expense, there are six places in each type of expense to insert a % in order to calculate the expense amounts as a % of sales. These are intended to input a % for each of Years 1-3, however it can be used as the User desires. The balance of the inputs available in each expense section are for input of direct amounts instead of a %.
