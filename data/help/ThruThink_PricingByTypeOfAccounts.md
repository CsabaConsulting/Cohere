### Type of Accounts Overview
The Individual Quick Deal is a one time only assessment of one deal and will provide a ThruThink Evaluation and a report containing a Deal Summary, Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow and Sources and Uses of Cash.
It does not involve a subscription to the ThruThink site. The Individual Quick Deal purchase price may be applied to a subscription within 3 months of purchasing the Individual Quick Deal analysis.

### ThruThink Deal Score
The ThruThink Evaluation evaluates the "Deal" or comparative benefit to the Owner as presented by the User Inputs and calculates the ThruThink Deal Score. It is not necessarily a score for the quality of the Company itself, but a score for the "Deal". In other words, an excellent Company can receive a poor Deal Score because of the level of the purchase price or valuation, improper debt or equity structure, capital expenditures, owner draws, etc. The ThruThink Deal Score is available with the Individual Quick Deal and the ThruThink subscription.
The ThruThink Deal Score uses proprietary algorithms and relationships that evaluates multiple factors involving historical information, the transaction itself and the projections which result in an overall grade or score for the "Deal".

### Individual Budgets
For each Company, Data Inputs are inputted separately and saved as an Individual Project. Projects may be combined into one summary project. Individual Projects can be Companies, Products (sku's), Departments, Properties, Manufacturing sectors, Processing areas, Crops on a farm or any individual budgeted area. For Corporate accounts, whoever inputs the data will become the "Author". The Author can give access permission to specific individuals, for example, the Division Mgr. or VP of Mfg., the Senior VP of Operations and the CEO.
