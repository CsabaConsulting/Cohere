# Individually Scheduled Section A Accounts Receivable Year 1 Inputs
## Category: Assets
By entering accounts receivable amounts on the Individually Scheduled Accounts Receivable page, the form will setup and record the accounts receivable amounts as beginning Individually Scheduled Accounts Receivable for end of the period just prior to Year 1 (the Effective Date) and by entering the monthly information, it will indicate when the beginning accounts receivables are collected during Year 1.
This information will affect cash flow, but will not affect accrual income in Year 1 unless the User has chosen Cash as the tax basis and in that case this information will be income for Year 1.
Depending on the selection made, the accounts receivable amounts entered on this form, Section A, will feed to either the Transaction Sheet or the Existing Company financial information (the "Show On" selection) as beginning accounts receivable as of the Effective Date.
