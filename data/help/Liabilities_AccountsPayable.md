# Accounts Payable
## Category: Liabilities
Accounts Payable (A/P) are normal operating expenses incurred by the Company that have not yet been paid. Accounts Payable are a common part of the normal operations of most companies.
In the calculations, expenses will be recognized when they are incurred, not necessarily when they are paid. When an expense is incurred and not paid, the amount of the expense becomes an Account Payable (AP). Increasing A/P's is considered a source of cash similar to obtaining a loan for the expenses not paid. The User may enter an estimate for the % of expenses that will not be paid at the time they are incurred in the Accounts Future Terms Set-Up page in the Debt Input page.
Accounts Payable are generally categorized by Less than 30 days, 30-60 Days, Over 60 Days. Days to pay may be selected by the User.
The Beginning Accounts Payable are obligations of the Company as of the Company purchase date (Effective Date).
Beginning Accounts Payable are usually not part of an asset only Company purchase. If they are however, the purchase price (for the purposes of this funding analysis) should be increased and the A/P's are then shown as a source of financing the Company purchase.
The Beginning A/P's will flow into the 1st year cash flow calculations and be paid in accordance with the User Inputs in the Accounts Payable Future Terms Set-up.
### If EBITDA Override is in effect:
If the User has chosen to override Sales and Cost of Goods Sold with a direct EBITDA override, the A/P will be the prior year ending balance, therefore there will be no change in A/P with an EBITDA override. The A/P's may be manually changed however by using an Adjusting Journal Entry (AJE).
### Accounts Payable Percent Calculation
This can be found in the Weekly Cash Flow Detail.
Accounts Payable (AP) as a percent of COGS, Overhead and Increase in Inventory expense is the result of the Accounts Payable - Future Set-Up Factors (See Information Browser) chosen by the User. The actual percent comes from the final A/P balance derived from a weekly cash flow analysis divided by the Annual COGS, Overhead and increase in Inventory.
When expenses are paid consistently on a weekly basis this percentage number will be small as it is a percent of weekly expenses as A/P's divided by the total expenses for the year.
When expenses are paid consistently on a monthly basis this percentage number will still be small, however it will be bigger than the number based on a weekly pay cycle.
As the days to pay the A/P's as entered on the Accounts Payable Future Terms Set-Up page increases over 30 days, the percentage of total annual expenses will of course increase.
The percentage calculated from Year 3 is used for the balance of the Horizon Years.
