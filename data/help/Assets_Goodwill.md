## Category: Assets
Goodwill is found on the Balance Sheet in the Amortized Assets Asset category.
The amount paid for the Company that exceeds the Value of the Company's Assets at the time of purchase will be capitalized to Amortized Asset category as Goodwill on the Balance Sheet.

If there is a Performance Earn Out Note considered as part of the purchase price of the Company, each year, if the Earn Out Note fluctuates (such as due to the future performance of the Company) and changes the ultimate price paid for the company, the Goodwill (the revised Purchase Price due to the change in the Earn Out Note in excess of the value of the assets at the time of purchase) will be adjusted to reflect the increase or decrease in the amount paid for the Company (which reflects the  amount of the Performance Earn Out Note).
