# Historical Worksheet - Enter EBITDA Only
## Category: Historical Worksheet
On the Historical Worksheet, the User may skip entering Income and Expenses separately. Enter the EBITDA amount in the 'Add back' section of the page as an add back adjustment.
The *ThruThink Evaluation* however uses historical sales in its analysis and entering EBITDA without Sales will cause the evaluation to be less accurate. Because of this, historic sales may be entered in the Sales Section of the page and that same Sales total reversed out by entering a negative amount for the Sales total in the EBITDA 'Add back' section of the page. In this manner, the EBITDA will reflect only the EBITDA only input.
