# Individually Scheduled Items-Other Current Assets
## Category: Assets
The Individually Scheduled Other Current Asset Items are interest bearing and will be automatically collected in the month indicated in the next fiscal year period unless annually renewed (see Annual Renewal below). If no month is indicated and it is not renewed, it will be collected in month 12. This type of asset is generally short term investments to be collected within 12 months. The Individually Scheduled Items can be applied to either the Transaction Sheet for the Target Company or directly to the Existing Company during the beginning asset setup for either the Target Company or Existing Company.
### Annual Renewal
For the Individually Scheduled portion of the Other Current Assets, there is an annual selection on the Other Current Asset page (see Information Browser - Other Current Asset Balance Detail). For each year of the Horizon, by selecting 'Yes', the entire category will be renewed and the asset anniversaries will all be extended by 12 months.
This asset is represented on the Balance Sheet under Current Assets even if renewed every year. It will be considered due within 12 months at all times.
