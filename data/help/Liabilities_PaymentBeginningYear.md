# Payment Beginning Year
## Category: Liabilities
On several of the debt input options in the *ThruThink* analysis there is a Payment Beginning Year option. When this occurs, the Payment Beginning Year will indicate when the payments should begin. Interest will accrue from the initial period of the Note, however, cash payments of Interest and or Principal will not begin until the Beginning Year indicated. This is designed for the Seller Base Note, to provide the option of delaying cash being used for the Seller Base Note. Often when a Seller Note is involved, the debt holders in senior position to the Seller Note will not allow cash being used to pay the Seller Note until the Company has demonstrated sufficient performance to pay back debt senior to the Seller Note or until a substantial amount (or all) of the senior debt has been paid.
All of the unpaid Seller Note interest will be an Accrued Interest expense and become an Accrued Interest liability on the Company Balance Sheet.
