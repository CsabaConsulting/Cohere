# Accounts Receivable Weeks to Collect
## Category: Assets
### Beginning Accounts Receivables
This is the time over which the Beginning A/R will be collected in cash. Collection will be evenly collected over this time. This will apply to Beginning A/R balances only, after which, the input for the Future Ave Weeks to Collect will be used for the Horizon Period Years. If there is no selection for the future years, the default for future years will be the input for the Beginning A/R balance. If this is left blank, 0 will be used and all sales will be collected in the Sale period.
If the Existing Company is purchasing the Target Company, for Year 1, a weighted average will be calculated between the Weeks to Carry listed on the Transaction Sheet for the Target Company and the Weeks to Carry for the Existing Company. For Years after Year 1, the selections in the Ave Weeks to Collect in the Future Input will be used with no weighted average calculation. If there is no inputs to the Ave Weeks to Collect in the Future and there is no selection indicated in the Transaction Sheet, the entry for the Existing Company will be used for future years.
This Input is found in the Accounts Receivable Set Up pages for the Transaction Sheet and the Existing Company Accounts Receivable Beginning Balances.
### Accounts Receivable Future Weeks to Collect
This will apply for future Horizon Period years selected by the User.
Weeks to Collect are the number of weeks on average that the Accounts Receivables will be outstanding.
For example, with Accounts Receivables, if cash is collected at the point of sale, then the Weeks to Collect can be 0. If on the other hand all sales are on "account" and are all paid within 30-60 days, then 6 weeks can be used.
This input is found in the Accounts Receivable - Future Terms Set-Up  Input page
The Input should be a whole number and not a portion of a week.
