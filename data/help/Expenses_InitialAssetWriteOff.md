# Initial Asset Write Off
## Category: Expenses
This provision is intended for the User who is a Buyer of the Company to Write Off a percentage of the initial Asset value that is being paid to the Seller of the Company to reflect general confidence issues with the asset at the time of purchase or analysis.
If a certain value must be paid to the Seller, however the User (Buyer) doubts the value used for the asset, the User can write off a portion of the beginning value but not change the Purchase Price paid to the Seller. The value after the Write Off will flow into the post closing Balance Sheet.
The Input is a Percentage of the value being paid to the Seller of the particular Initial Asset Value.
The Initial Write Off will reduce the initial value of the asset by the % of the Write Off. The write off will apply to the applicable balances of the indicated asset for either the Transaction Sheet or the Existing Company financial input sheet. The Write Off will be applied in the pre-closing transaction and adjust the beginning balance of the first period. It should be considered as an adjustment to the beginning basis value of the assets involved. It will not have an effect on net income or loss.
The effect of the Write Off will be to increase the Goodwill paid for the Company.
This input is available on the Transaction Sheet Asset Input page for the major asset categories and is found in Step 5.
