# Income Statement
## Category: Income Statement
The Income Statement is a statement of Profit and Loss indicating Net Income and is calculated on an Accrual Basis. This means that Income and Expenses are recognized in the period that they are incurred, regardless of when they are paid. Inventory, Accounts Receivable, Cost of Goods Sold, Accounts Payable and Accrued Income and Expenses are examples of items used to reflect the period the item is incurred vs. the period they are paid or received. Cash Flow however, reflects actual cash receipts and cash outflow. There is a Sources and Uses of Cash Statement that shows the relationship between Net Income and Cash Flow.
