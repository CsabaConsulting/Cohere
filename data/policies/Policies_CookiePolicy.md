To track your new and returning visits to our Marketing Site we use

visits. For our Application Site, we only use Google Analytics. This
information is used by us to observe and keep track of how visitors use
our site including things like the number of users, first time users,
pages visited, how much time was spent on each page, etc. In some cases,
our cookies may collect your IP address in this process, however we do
not use this information for marketing or any other purpose other than
in our analytic process.

**Google Analytics**

*ThruThink*® uses Google Analytics to help us to better manage our
marketing site. Google Analytics stores information about your visit to
this website such as:

> How you came to our site

>
> How much time you spent on our site
>
> Which Pages you visited
>

>
> Are you a New User or Repeat User

This is not a complete list of the information that Google Analytics

[Analytics opt-out browser add-on]{.underline}. The add-on prevents the
Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) that is
running on websites from sharing information with Google Analytics about
visit activity.

**Hotjar**

*ThruThink*® also uses Hotjar
[(]{.underline}[http://www.hotjar.com](http://www.hotjar.com/)[)]{.underline}
on the Marketing Site in order to better understand our users' needs and
to optimize how the website is performing. We do not use Hotjar on the
Application Site

Hotjar is a technology service that helps us better understand our users
experience (e.g. how much time they spend on which pages, which links
they choose to click, what users do and don't like, etc.) and this
enables us to build and maintain our service with user feedback. Hotjar
uses cookies and other technologies to collect data on our users'
behavior and their devices (in particular device\'s IP address (captured
and stored only in anonymized form), device screen size, device type
(unique device identifiers), browser information, geographic location
(country only), preferred language used to display our website). Hotjar
stores this information in a pseudonymized user profile. Neither Hotjar
nor we will ever use this information to identify individual users or to
match it with further data on an individual user. For further details,
please see Hotjar's privacy policy by clicking on this link
(<http://www.hotjar.com/legal/policies/privacy>).
